## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application requires the following environment variables:

```
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_admin_password
SECRET_KEY=your_very_secure_random_string_at_least_32_chars_long
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-host:6379
LLM_ENDPOINT=http://your-llm-endpoint:11434/v1
LLM_API_KEY=your_llm_api_key
TWS_HOST=your-tws-host
TWS_PORT=31111
TWS_USER=your-tws-username
TWS_PASSWORD=your-tws-password
```

### Settings Configuration
The application uses a hierarchical configuration system with:
- Base settings in `settings.toml`
- Environment-specific overrides in `settings.{environment}.toml`
- Environment variables with `APP_` prefix

## Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
# Run with mock TWS data (default)
uvicorn resync.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Production Mode
```bash
# Run with real TWS connection
uvicorn resync.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Docker
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker build -t resync .
docker run -p 8000:8000 resync
```

## API Endpoints
