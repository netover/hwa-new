Codacy CLI is not supported on Windows without WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). When working on Windows, code quality analysis should be performed using alternative methods such as: 1) Running analysis in a Linux environment or WSL, 2) Using GitHub Actions or other CI/CD pipelines that run on Linux, or 3) Using local Python linters like pylint, mypy, and bandit which are fully compatible with Windows. The code changes made to resync/api/chat.py have been verified to have no linter errors and proper type hints.
