# Task Description
Implementar melhorias identificadas na análise do código, incluindo: (1) Adicionar resiliência de rede com backoff exponencial usando `tenacity`; (2) Tornar parâmetros de cache (shards e TTL) configuráveis via variáveis de ambiente; (3) Melhorar gerenciamento de ciclo de vida do Redis com padrões como Circuit Breaker; e (4) Abordar lacunas como o placeholder para Knowledge Graph se aplicável.

# Project Overview
Projeto em `D:\Python\GITHUB\hwa-new-1` envolve módulos como `resync/main.py`, `resync/core/cache_hierarchy.py` e conexões Redis/TWS, com foco em assincronia, cache e resiliência. Melhorias visam elevar robustez sem quebrar funcionalidades existentes.

# Execution Protocol:

## 1. Create feature branch
1. Create a new task branch from [MAIN_BRANCH]:
  ```
  git checkout -b task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
2. Add the branch name to the [TASK_FILE] under "Task Branch."
3. Verify the branch is active:
  ```
  git branch --show-current
  ```
4. Update "Current execution step" in [TASK_FILE] to next step

## 2. Create the task file
1. Execute command to generate [TASK_FILE_NAME]:
   ```
   [TASK_FILE_NAME]="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)_$(($(ls -1q .tasks | grep -c $(date +%Y-%m-%d)) + 1))"
   ```
2. Create [TASK_FILE] with strict naming:
   ```
   mkdir -p .tasks && touch ".tasks/${TASK_FILE_NAME}_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md"
   ```
3. Verify file creation:
   ```
   ls -la ".tasks/${TASK_FILE_NAME}_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md"
   ```
4. Copy ENTIRE Task File Template into new file
5. Insert Execution Protocol EXACTLY, in verbatim, by:
-   - Copying text between "-- [START OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL]" and "-- [END OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL]"
-   - Adding "⚠️ WARNING: NEVER MODIFY THIS SECTION ⚠️" both as header and a footer
+   a. Find the protocol content between [START OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL] and [END OF EXECUTION PROTOCOL] markers above
+   b. In the task file:
+      1. Replace "[FULL EXECUTION PROTOCOL COPY]" with the ENTIRE protocol content from step 5a
+      2. Keep the warning header and footer: "⚠️ WARNING: NEVER MODIFY THIS SECTION ⚠️"
6. Systematically populate ALL placeholders:
   a. Run commands for dynamic values:
      ```
      [DATETIME]="$(date +'%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S')"
      [USER_NAME]="$(whoami)"
      [TASK_BRANCH]="$(git branch --show-current)"
      ```
   b. Fill [PROJECT_OVERVIEW] by recursively analyzing mentioned files:
      ```
      find [PROJECT_ROOT] -type f -exec cat {} + | analyze_dependencies
      ```
7. Cross-verify completion:
   - Check ALL template sections exist
   - Confirm NO existing task files were modified
8. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol
9. Print full task file contents for verification

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Confirm [TASK_FILE] with user before proceeding >>>

## 3. Analysis
1. Analyze code related to [TASK]:
  - Identify core files/functions
  - Trace code flow
2. Document findings in "Analysis" section
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Wait for analysis confirmation >>>

## 4. Proposed Solution
1. Create plan based on analysis:
  - Research dependencies
  - Add to "Proposed Solution"
2. NO code changes yet
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Get solution approval >>>

## 5. Iterate on the task
1. Review "Task Progress" history
2. Plan next changes
3. Present for approval:
  ```
  [CHANGE PLAN]
  - Files: [CHANGED_FILES]
  - Rationale: [EXPLANATION]
  ```
4. If approved:
  - Implement changes
  - Append to "Task Progress":
    ```

    - Reason: [reason for the changes]
    - Blockers: [list of blockers preventing this update from being successful]
    - Status: [UNCONFIRMED|SUCCESSFUL|UNSUCCESSFUL]
    ```
5. Ask user: "Status: SUCCESSFUL

- Blockers: None.
- Status: SUCCESSFUL/UNSUCCESSFUL?"
6. If UNSUCCESSFUL: Repeat from 5.1
7. If SUCCESSFUL:
  a. Commit? → `git add [FILES] && git commit -m "[SHORT_MSG]"`
  b. More changes? → Repeat step 5
  c. Continue? → Proceed
8. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

## 6. Task Completion
1. Stage changes (exclude task files):
  ```
  git add --all :!.tasks/*
  ```
2. Commit with message:
  ```
  git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
  ```
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

<<< HALT IF NOT [YOLO_MODE]: Confirm merge with [MAIN_BRANCH] >>>

## 7. Merge Task Branch
1. Merge explicitly:
  ```
  git checkout [MAIN_BRANCH]
  git merge task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
2. Verify merge:
  ```
  git diff [MAIN_BRANCH] task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
3. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

## 8. Delete Task Branch
1. Delete if approved:
  ```
  git branch -d task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE_AND_NUMBER]
  ```
2. Set the "Current execution step" tp the name and number of the next planned step of the exectution protocol

## 9. Final Review

# Analysis
- Core files identified: resync/main.py (for watch_config_changes, lifespan, and Redis management), resync/core/cache_hierarchy.py (for cache parameters).
- Code flow traced: In resync/main.py, watch_config_changes (line 300) uses awatch() with basic exception handling but no retry mechanism. Lifespan() handles Redis/TWS initialization and shutdown. In cache_hierarchy.py, CacheHierarchy uses settings for some params (e.g., L2_TTL from settings.CACHE_HIERARCHY_L2_TTL) but has hardcoded defaults for others (e.g., num_shards=8 in TWS_OptimizedAsyncCache).
- Findings: No backoff in network operations, cache shards/TTL partially configurable, no Circuit Breaker for Redis failures. Placeholder for Knowledge Graph exists in initialize_core_systems.

# Proposed Solution
1. Add tenacity to requirements.txt and implement @retry with wait_random_exponential in watch_config_changes() for backoff on failures.
2. Update cache_hierarchy.py to make num_shards and other params configurable via settings (e.g., CACHE_HIERARCHY_NUM_SHARDS).
3. Integrate pybreaker for Circuit Breaker in Redis/TWS operations in main.py.
4. Optionally expand Knowledge Graph placeholder if time permits.
Dependencies: Install tenacity and pybreaker. Research: Ensure settings have new vars.
