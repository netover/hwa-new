- resync/ (tool_definitions/tws_tools.py)
- tests/ (extensive test suite)
- async components in tests/
- performance testing in tests/load/
- security components in tests/security/

# Analysis
## 1. Error Handling Analysis

### API and Network Errors
- ‚úÖ **Resync API**: Uses robust error handling with specific exceptions (`ConnectionError`, `NetworkError`, `TimeoutError`) in endpoints (e.g., `/health/tws`, `/dashboard`)
- ‚ùó **Missing retries**: While using `http_retry`, some critical endpoints only attempt 3 retries (e.g., TWS client). Consider implementing exponential backoff for better resilience.

### Cache Implementation
- üöÄ **Async Cache Optimization**: The `AsyncTTLCache` implementation is solid with sharded locks for high concurrency. However:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Shard count**: 16 shards may be excessive for typical workloads. Start with fewer shards (4-8) and monitor contention.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Cleanup interval**: 30 seconds might be too frequent for some deployments. Consider making this configurable.

### Async Operations
- üîÅ **Recovery Mechanisms**: Good use of `asynccontextmanager` for async operations, but:
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited retries**: Some async operations (e.g., LLM calls) only retry 3 times. Consider implementing circuit breakers.

### Redis Management
- üß† **Redis Connection Pooling**: Proper use of connection pooling in TWS client.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Connection draining**: Add explicit cleanup and reconnect logic for Redis during service lifecycle events.

## 2. Proposed Solution

### Error Handling Improvements
1. **Exponential Backoff**: Implement exponential backoff with jitter for critical network calls using `tenacity` library
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures in LLM calls using `pybreaker`

### Cache Optimization
1. **Dynamic Sharding**: Implement dynamic shard count adjustment based on load using `redis` metrics
2. **Smart Cleanup**: Make cleanup interval dynamic based on cache hit ratio and memory usage

### Async Operations
1. **Enhanced Retry Logic**: Implement adaptive retry logic that adjusts based on error characteristics using `httpx` retry extension

### Redis Management
1. **Connection Lifecycle Management**: Add proper shutdown and reconnect logic using `asyncio` context managers

# Proposed Solution Research
- [Research exponential backoff strategies for network resilience]
- [Investigate circuit breaker implementation for LLM operations]
- [Benchmark dynamic cache sharding vs fixed shard count with Redis]
- [Research Redis connection management best practices for production]
